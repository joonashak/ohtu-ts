# User manual

This is a short documentation on how to run the __Reading tips program__. First, ensure that you have a working Java installation. Using a typical Linux installation, traverse to the project folder and execute the supplied gradlew-script using the command

```bash
./gradlew run 
```
or if you have gradle installed on your system
```bash
gradle run
```

The program starts. Now, you can issue commands by following the on-screen instructions, typing them on the screen and pressing enter on your keyboard. Currently adding reading tips (book/video/blog), listing all of them, viewing a single tip and opening a link into a browser are supported operations. Typing the command 

```bash
3
```

exits the program.
